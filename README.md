Flappy-duino - Flappy Bird on Arduino
=====================================

Given the current craze around the game Flappy Bird I thought it would be interesting to see if I could write something similar on Arduino using the Adafruit TFT LCD touchscreen shield.  A few hours of coding and here is the result.  I'm quite impressed that the Arduino will run fast enough.
